# Datathon25_IM_EK_MZ_GF
Our repository contains three python notebooks (.ipynb files): one records some past models/“experiments” that failed but served as learning experiences, another contains a comparison of four different models (discussed in our video), and the final is our finished product (which writes our predicted results to a csv). To reproduce our results, please run the latter (titled “FINAL Model”) with the files ‘Test_Set_EEG.csv’ and ‘Train_and_Validate_EEG.csv’ as inputs. The file outputted will be titled 'Test_Prediction_EEG.csv’; this can also be found in our repository. Note that our model predicts only the main disorder, so this file contains two columns (‘ID’ and ‘main.disorder.class’).
